# Hotel-Room-Calculator
This program was coded in C++. This was a program I had created to see how much of an efficient code I could write. When I had started learning there was an assignment similar to this that I had found really hard. Later on with all my experiences, I created this  program to see how fast and efficient code I could write after gaining experience to see my progress.
